== The DreamHack Game Task Delivery Platform

This is the platform used to deliver tasks in The DreamHack Game puzzle-hunt that is held at DreamHack.

It's a rails application that uses S3 for data storage and is ready to deploy to heroku.

If you have a game where you want to give the user a task that has a password and when the user puts in that password he gets the next task; this is the app for you.

The Admin UI is halfway done and I'm open-sourcing it because I will not be supporting the development any further and I hope someone else wants to pick it up.
